     <h1>Past, Current, and Future projects</h1>
     <h2>Past Projects: Grocery List</h2>
     <p>This is a project I have done in the past. This project focus on the li and ul listing properties to either make a organize list or an unoriganize list.</p>
     <a link ="https://github.com/wumega0924/Grocery-list">Link to my past project</a>
     <h2>Current Project: Personal Website</h2>
     <p>This website is currently my current project on hand and is still working to improve it. This project focuses on using many html and css properties to make my website layout the way I want it to be</p>
     <a link ="https://github.com/wumega0924/Personal-Website">Link to my current project</a>
     <h2>Plans for Future Projects</h2>
     <p>I have a few ideas in mind on kind of projects to work on in the future. First I would like to make a website that could display a full menu and could connect to the restaurants printers and credit card machine. I also plan to make a Point of Sale system which can help intergrate other service platforms like Doordash, Ubereats, and Grubhub.</p>
